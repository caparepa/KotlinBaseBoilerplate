# KotlinBaseBoilerplate

This is a sample boilerplate project, that contains the following elements:

- Kotlin
- Retrofit
- Coroutines
- Glide
- AndroidX
- Android Navigation Components
- Model-View-ViewModel architectural pattern

Currently this project is work-in-progress, using the [Weatherbit.io API](https://weatherbit.io/) as primary data source.
It used to connect to the WeatherStack API, but migrated due limitations.

This tutorial is based on the tutorial ["Forecast App - Android Kotlin MVVM Tutorial Course"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB6lc7nQ1n4jTLDyU2muTBo8xk0dg0D_w),
by [Reso Coder](https://github.com/ResoCoder), with a few modifications to fit the current requirements of this project.
